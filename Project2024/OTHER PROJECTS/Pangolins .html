            <h1><span>Pangolins Conservation</span></h1><br><br>    
            <p class="par">
                Pangolins are unique and fascinating mammals known for their distinctive scales and solitary, nocturnal lifestyle. 
                Belonging to the order Pholidota, they are often referred to as "scaly anteaters" due to their diet and appearance. 
                There are eight species of pangolins, four in Africa and four in Asia, <br> each adapted to its specific habitat ranging from tropical 
                forests to savannas.<br> These scales serve as a defense mechanism; when threatened, a pangolin can curl into a tight ball, making it difficult 
                for predators to penetrate the tough, overlapping scales. Despite their formidable armor, pangolins face significant threats from 
                humans and are the most trafficked mammals in the world. Their scales are highly valued in traditional medicine, particularly in China 
                and Vietnam, and their meat is considered a delicacy in some cultures.Pangolins primarily feed on ants and termites,
                which they locate using their keen sense of smell<br>Their long, sticky tongues can extend to impressive lengths, allowing 
                them to probe into insect nests. Lacking teeth, pangolins use their strong stomach muscles and swallowed stones to grind the insects 
                they consume. This specialized diet means they play a crucial role in their ecosystems by controlling insect populations.
                Reproduction in pangolins is characterized by a gestation period that varies between species, typically lasting between 70 to 140 days. 
                Females usually give birth to one offspring at a time, which they carry on their backs or tails until the young are capable of 
                independent survival.Conservation efforts are critical for the survival of pangolins, as all species are listed under varying degrees 
                of threat by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
