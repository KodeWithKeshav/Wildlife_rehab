            <p class="par">
                Bear conservation and rehabilitation centers play a pivotal role in the protection and recovery of bear populations 
                worldwide. These centers are dedicated facilities where injured, orphaned, or displaced bears receive medical care, 
                rehabilitation, and, if possible, preparation for re-release into the wild. Their work addresses the growing threats 
                to bear populations, including habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.<br>

                One of the primary functions of these centers is to provide immediate medical care to bears that have suffered from 
                injuries due to poaching traps, vehicle collisions, or human-induced accidents. Veterinary teams at these centers are 
                equipped to handle a range of medical issues, from broken bones to malnutrition. For orphaned cubs, the centers provide 
                a safe environment where they can grow and learn essential survival skills that they would typically acquire from their 
                mothers.<br>

                Rehabilitation efforts focus on minimizing human interaction to ensure that bears do not become habituated to people, 
                which can hinder their chances of surviving in the wild. The process often includes simulated natural environments where 
                bears can practice foraging, climbing, and other behaviors crucial for their survival. Advanced rehabilitation programs 
                also incorporate "soft release" strategies, where bears are gradually acclimatized to the wild before full release, 
                increasing their chances of successful reintegration.
