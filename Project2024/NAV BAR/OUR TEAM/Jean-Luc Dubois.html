            <p class="description">
    Jean-Luc Dubois serves as the Executive Director for Think Wild, a non-profit wildlife hospital and conservation center in Bend, Oregon.
        Jean-Luc led the capital fundraising, construction and launch of the 4-acre Center, which now provides native OASIS rehabilitation,
    education, and conservation services to Central and parts of Eastern Oregon.<br>

    Jean-Luc has a B.S. in Evolutionary Biology and a Certificate in Marketing from Cornell University.
    he has a diverse background working in conservation and the non-profit sector, both internationally and locally.
    His experience includes leading communications and marketing for the Oregon Coast Aquarium, supporting conservation outreach at the
    Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and researching Endangered species in upstate New York, the Philippines, and South Africa.<br>
        
    Jean-Luc first got involved in wildlife rehabilitation while growing up in Florida, where he volunteered at a small,
    private rehabilitation center, rescuing orphaned baby raccoons off the side of the road and raising funds in front
    of the local PetSmart. He is ecstatic to be back in the field of wildlife rescue with more experience, and even more drive, in a leadership role.<br>
        
    Jean-Luc hopes to bring her skills in marketing, communications, and business management to strengthen collaboration, credibility,
    and awareness of conservation impacts in the field of OASIS rehabilitation.
