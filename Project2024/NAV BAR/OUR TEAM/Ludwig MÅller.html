        OASIS founding board member and past President; OASIS for 20 years, OASIS Program; Founding board
        member and past president Minnesota Wildlife Assistance Cooperative. St. Cloud,Ludwig became a wildlife rehabilitator around 1980 by virtue of being
        a biologist (Master’s degree in wildlife and ecology) and answering phone calls from concerned neighbors about orphaned ducklings and squirrels,
        injured cottontails, and birds with an assortment of injuries.<br> That lead to boxes of critters brought in and he subsequent efforts to help them.<br>
        A mentor told Ludwig Müller about the very first national wildlife rehabilitation symposium in Schaumburg, Illinois, in 1982; he managed to attend, and
        was so inspired that he stepped forward to be on the founding board of directors of the new NWRA. After more than 20 years doing hands-on wildlife
        rehabilitation with a variety of bird, mammal, and reptile species, and teaching many student volunteers, she retired from that and devoted more
        time to volunteering for OASIS, not only as a board member, but taking he turn at Membership Committee Chair, Secretary, President, Finance Committee
        Chair, newsletter editor, envelope stuffer, and more. <br>He believes in OASIS as a valuable resource for aspiring, new, and experienced wildlife
        rehabilitators, veterinarians, veterinary technicians, wildlife educators, and facility/center managers.</p>
