            I'm <span>JENNIFER CONVY<br /></span> a Secretary, Human Resources Committee Chair
        </h1>
        <p class="description">
            I have over 31 years of animal welfare experience including 29 years of supervisory and management experience in animal care, operations,
            and leadership positions overseeing over fifty employees with thirteen direct reports today.
            <br>I began my career in the equine and small animal
            veterinary field, then pivoted to a wildlife rehabilitation career at Missouri Wildlife Rescue Center as a Wildlife Technician and Center Manager
            before coming to PAWS Wildlife Center in 1996.
            <br>
            I served as an executive Board member for the OASIS
            and am the Secretary and Human Resources Chairperson for OASIS. I am a founding Board member and Past President of the Washington Wildlife
            Rehabilitation Association. I have represented PAWS on many task forces and advisory groups such as the Washington Department of Fish and
            Wildlifeâ€™s Wildlife Rehabilitation Advisory Committee. <br>
            My husband and I have three busy teenage sons and three cute PAWS dogs and live in
            Snohomish, Washington.<br>
            
            Currently I am busy at PAWS working on our new PAWS Wildlife Center facility along with directing our wildlife, shelter, and education departments.
            I have a personal and professional interest and love for wildlife rehabilitation and applying my skills to help OASIS is very meaningful to me..
